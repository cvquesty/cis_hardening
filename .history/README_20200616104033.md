## Description

This module is a base level hardening module designed to implement the CIS hardenng standards for CentOS7/RHEL7. There are no parameters, and there is no special calling protocol.  As with other modules with a single entry point:

include cis_hardening

or

puppet apply -e "include cis_hardening"

YMMV

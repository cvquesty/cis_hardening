## Description

This module is a base level hardening module designed to implement the CIS hardenng 
standards for CentOS7/RHEL7. There are no parameters, and there is no special calling 
protocol.  As with other modules with a single entry point:

include cis_hardening

or

puppet apply -e "include cis_hardening"

The hardening guide used was the CentOS Linux 7 Benchmark guide version 2.2.0
available from the Center for Internet Security.

All manifests explicitly list out the control then the method as does the unit and
the acceptance tests.

The Unit tests are in SPEC/RSPEC using the puppet-rspec library and the acceptance
tests are in serverspec utilizing the Puppet Litmus framework.

Documentation links ar as follows

Puppet RSPEC:  https://rspec-puppet.com
ServerSPEC:    https://serverspec.org
Puppet Litmus: https://puppetlabs.github.io/litmus/

It should be noted that since the acceptance testing affects Grub and other booting mechanisms
